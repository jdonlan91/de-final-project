For each ticket:

1. assign to a pair (or person)
2. make a new branch
3. write the tests alongside the code (TDD)
4. Makefile runs:

- PEP-8
- security
- unit tests all pass
- test coverage is above 90%

5. commit and push to same branch on github
6. review by someone who did not write the code
7. merge into main
